# Compact-Boolean-Fuctions

This C++ project simplifies the use of truth tables for binary logic.

Consider the following 'and' operator on two binary variables x1 and x2:

This can be expressed using the following binary tree:

The function 'buildbdt' takes in a vector of strings as input in order to construct the binary tree. These strings represent the binary values '1'. 

For example:

```
hi
```
